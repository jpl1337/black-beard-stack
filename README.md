BLACK BEARD STACK
(still in development)

Black Beard Stack is a docker compose stack for open source media management.
This project aims to be an easy to setup yet fully featured solution inspired by other projects like swizzin.

To use this project you'll need to install docker, set the minimum required variables, and bring up the stack!

This can be used to replace your current media management system, but make sure to manually import existing media first into Sonarr, Radarr, etc.
